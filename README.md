This is Frederic Merizenâ€™s blog.
It runs on [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
I got it rolling by starting from [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

# Development environment

There is a standard Docker-based development environment.
You start it by running ./dev-env (on linux or macos) or dev-env (on windows).

This gets you into a standard shell, and starts a jekyll server running in the background.
You can visit your local Jekyll site by going to [http://localhost:4000].

Shut down the development environment by running ./dock down.
