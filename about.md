I chose ‘rambling on code (in the widest possible sense)’ as a subtitle for my blog.
It’s intended to be mildly humorous, and also to reveal something about myself.

### Thinking in code

I work on software, and working with source code is both my passion and how I make a living.
Going from there and from my engineering background, I like to look at my surroundings through the lenses of models and metaphors.
Can everything be encoded, and should it?
Probably not – and still, it’s an interesting idea to play with.
Codes of conduct, moral codes, the code of law, typographic codes, genetic codes, photographic codes and of course [Software For Your Head][SFYH]: you name it, it’s fair game over here.
That and possibly more.
